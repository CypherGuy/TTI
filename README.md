# TTI

A simple program that takes in an image from another file, converts it into text and then optionally summarizes the text to you in bullet point form.

When forking a copy, please create two files: "image.png" to store the image, and "text.txt" for the text to be stored in your directory at the same level as "ImagetoText.py". 

You should ensure the image you want the text from is in "image.png".
