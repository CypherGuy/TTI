# TTI

A simple program that takes in an image from another file, converts it into text and then optionally summarizes the text to you in bullet point form.

When forking a copy, please create a file "image.png" in your directory at the same level as "ImagetoText.py". There you can put your image.

Once the program runs, the text is stored in "text.txt" for you to copy and paste as you see fit.
